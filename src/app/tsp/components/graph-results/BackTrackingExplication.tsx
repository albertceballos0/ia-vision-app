        {/* Introduction */}
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Backtracking algorithm is a brute-force approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by systematically exploring all possible routes 
          and finding the shortest path that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. Backtracking can be applied in different ways: 
          a standard approach, which exhaustively searches through all paths, or a <strong>greedy-enhanced backtracking</strong> approach, which attempts 
          to reduce computation by making local optimizations at each step.
        </p>

        {/* Standard Backtracking */}
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Standard Backtracking</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In standard backtracking, the algorithm explores each potential path fully by recursively expanding each possible route, checking if each partial 
          path meets the criteria for an optimal solution. At each step, it branches out to include each unvisited city in the current route and backtracks 
          when a dead-end or non-promising route is encountered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standard backtracking is exhaustive and evaluates all combinations without shortcuts, guaranteeing an optimal solution but at the expense of 
          high computational cost, especially for larger instances where the complexity grows factorially (O(n!)).
        </p>

        {/* Greedy Backtracking */}
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Greedy Backtracking</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Greedy backtracking aims to incorporate heuristics that can reduce computation by making local "greedy" decisions at each step. At each point in 
          the route, the algorithm selects the nearest unvisited city {'('}or the city with the lowest travel cost{')'} as the next candidate to explore further, 
          attempting to quickly find a solution close to optimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this approach can help reduce computation and reach a feasible solution faster, it does not guarantee an optimal solution. The greedy 
          choices made at each step may lead the algorithm down suboptimal paths that require additional backtracking, especially when the locally optimal 
          choice does not contribute to a globally optimal route.
        </p>

        {/* Key Concepts */}
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Key Concepts and Terminology</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Current Path:</strong> The partial sequence of cities being evaluated at each stage of the recursion.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimum Cost Path:</strong> Tracks the lowest-cost path found so far, updated whenever a more cost-effective route is identified.</li>
          <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Eliminates branches where the partial pathâ€™s cost exceeds the minimum known cost, helping to narrow down the search.</li>
          <li><strong>Recursive Calls:</strong> Each call expands the current path by adding an unvisited city, exploring all possibilities at each level.</li>
          <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> If a path reaches a dead-end, it "backs up" to try alternative routes, ensuring exhaustive exploration.</li>
          <li><strong>Greedy Selection {'('}in Greedy Backtracking{')'}:</strong> A heuristic choice of the next city based on the lowest immediate cost, balancing 
              between exploration and efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
